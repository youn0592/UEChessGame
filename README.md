# UEChessGame
A personal project for my portfolio, creating Chess within Unreal Engine 5.1 
for more information on me or the project, head over to https://www.cyoungportfolio.com/home/ue-chessgame

ABOUT: 
The All time classic strategy game made entirely from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Take control of your army of 8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, a Queen, and a King as you race your opponent to Checkmate. Make every move matter as you never know what your opponent is thinking. Features include Piece Killing, King Checking, Current Piece Move Locations, Rook/King Castling, and a jazzy soundtrack (provided by Kevin MacLeod)

HOW TO PLAY: 
* Game is played entirely with the Mouse, Click on Chess Piece and click on Cell you would like to move the piece towards. 
* When Killing another Chess Piece, you can select either the Cell or the Piece in order to Kill it.
* When transforming a Pawn into another piece, select any piece in the list on the Popup UI, the option you select will turn the Pawn into that piece.
* Pressing ESC will automatically close the game.
* When trying to Castle with the King and Rook, make sure you select the King, and press the Yellow Cell bellow the Rook, clicking on the rook when trying to castle will cancel the castle and make the player select the Rook instead.
